This past Friday, I had the opportunity to present some initial research findings at the Ohio Entrepreneurship Research Roundtable hosted by Miami University. My presentation, "Confidence Women: Gender, Empowerment, and Entrepreneurial Mythmaking in the Wellness MLM Industry," was on an early-stage project looking at the intersection of entrepreneurship, gender, and the history of wellness-focused Multi-Level Marketing companies. Even in the early stages, we've begun to uncover how these organizations leverage specific narratives of empowerment to recruit and retain participants. It was great to share these preliminary thoughts with colleagues and get feedback that will help shape the next phase of our research. We're excited to see where this project leads as we continue to dive into the data.
