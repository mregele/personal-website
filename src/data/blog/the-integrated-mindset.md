# The Integrated Mindset: Why Business and Liberal Arts are Better Together

## Introduction
In the recurring "Dog's Dinner" of university strategic plans, we often see a strange phenomenon: a push for "innovation" and "entrepreneurship" that exists in a vacuum, disconnected from the deep intellectual traditions of the Liberal Arts. While we often acknowledge the different "vibes" of various colleges, we risk falling into functional silos. Business schools are frequently viewed—and often view themselves—as the engine of practical, career-relevant application. Meanwhile, Arts & Sciences are seen as the keepers of foundational inquiry and the "soul" of the institution. But in reality, neither can truly fulfill its mission without the other. To return to the faculty core, we need to stop treating these colleges as separate machines and start seeing them as a single, integrated design for action. But as Richard Rumelt argues, this isn't a strategy—it's a [**"Dog's Dinner."**](https://a.co/d/05udhSX5)

## Business is a Mindset, Not Just a Toolset
There is a tendency to treat business education as purely "technical"—a collection of perishable skills like spreadsheet modeling or marketing analytics. This is a mistake. Business education, at its best, is a distinct mindset. It is a way of thinking about resource allocation, incentive structures, and organizational design. It is about understanding how to move an idea from a concept to a sustainable reality. However, that mindset is incomplete on its own. Like the liberal arts, business has its own frameworks, but when those frameworks are applied without a broader critical lens, they can become narrow or disconnected from the human context in which they operate.

## The Liberal Arts as a Competitive Advantage
This is where the Arts & Sciences come in. The liberal arts are not just about "soft skills" or "enrichment." They are the primary tools for thinking critically and flexibly. They bring diverse perspectives - for example, historical, sociological, and philosophical - to bear on complex problems. When you combine the business mindset with the liberal arts, you get:

* **Innovative Leaders:** People who don't just ask "how do we do this?" but "why are we doing this, and what are the long-term consequences?"
* **Flexibility:** While specific content can be fleeting, the ability to synthesize diverse perspectives is a durable skill that lasts an entire career.
* **Ethical Depth:** Ethical leadership isn't just about following a compliance handbook; it's about having the critical depth to navigate the "dark sides" of entrepreneurship and industry.

## The Metric Trap: Why Silos Persist
If the benefits of integration are so clear, why do silos remain so fortified? The answer usually lies in perverse institutional incentives. Most universities are obsessed with "counting majors" as the primary metric of departmental health. This creates a hoarding mentality. When I was helping build the Organizational Leadership major at Miami University, we encountered this firsthand. Because I was in the Sociology department at the time, we actually faced pushback from the Management department for simply using the word "leadership" in the title. There was an underlying assumption that "leadership" was the exclusive intellectual property of the business school. This is not only a narrow view of a complex human phenomenon—one that management scholars often view through a fairly specific, and at times incomplete, lens—but it's a strategic failure. If a department is only rewarded for the students it "owns," there is no incentive to share the universal concepts that students actually need to succeed. We should be looking at the **diversity and volume of students served**. A Business school that provides organizational literacy to history and biology majors is arguably creating more institutional value than one that merely maximizes its own headcount.

## Small Examples of Success
This isn't just theory; we see mini-versions of this integration whenever we align our structures correctly. In my Social Entrepreneurship course, for instance, the classroom is often a mix of business majors and students from across the humanities and social sciences. This mix isn't a result of some pedagogical magic trick. It happened because of a concerted effort to talk to department chairs and ensure the course counted—whether as part of an Entrepreneurship minor or as a relevant elective for their own majors. When we make the structural choice to let a course "count" across college lines, we lower the barrier for students to engage in mental cross-training. The result is a classroom that helps business students learn to see the social context of their models, and arts and sciences students learn how to use organizational tools to manifest their values. I'm not arguing that my course is perfect or that I'm some sort of genius for creating it. I simply mention it as a small-scale, imperfect proof of concept for what the entire university could look like.

## Conclusion
If, as I believe, the goal of the university should be to prepare students to be [**"at home in all lands and all ages."**](https://www.bowdoin.edu/about/the-offer/index.html), that must include the land of organizational management and the land of critical inquiry. We don't need more "transformation" committees. We need a handful of hard choices that reward collaboration over hoarding and allow our students to graduate not just with a degree, but with an integrated mindset—flexible, ethical, and ready to lead.
