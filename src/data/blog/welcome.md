Welcome! I'm Matthew Regele, an Associate Professor of Management & Entrepreneurship and Director of Assessment at Xavier University's Williams College of Business.

I built this site as a home for my academic work and a space to share ideas that don't fit neatly into a journal article or a conference presentation. Here you'll find information about my [research](/research), my [teaching](/teaching), and — over time — blog posts on topics I'm thinking about.

## What I Work On

My research examines how the stories organizations tell about purpose, power, and profit shape strategic choices, individual careers, and venture outcomes. I study these dynamics across a range of settings, from startup labor markets and wellness MLMs to outlaw motorcycle clubs and higher education ventures.

In the classroom, I teach entrepreneurship and management courses grounded in the belief that students learn best by making real decisions under uncertainty. My courses combine field projects, simulations, and critical case analysis to prepare students for the messy realities of organizational life.

## What to Expect Here

I plan to use this blog to write about topics at the intersection of entrepreneurship, organizational strategy, and higher education — including reflections on research in progress, teaching experiments, and broader questions about how organizations work and why they sometimes don't.

Thanks for visiting. Feel free to reach out at [regelem@xavier.edu](mailto:regelem@xavier.edu) if you'd like to connect.
